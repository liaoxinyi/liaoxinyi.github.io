> The Happy Life of Programming.

&emsp;&emsp;Different work, works differently. All walks of life have their own unique systems and forms of existence. I have never regretted that I chose to put myself on petroleum when studying. What's more, it's only three years of graduate student's time to really get in touch with industry technology. It's about oil projects, but it's more like the engineering application of computer. Because of being in the zone of interdisciplinary integration, I have exercised my coding ability virtually. From VB to VBA, then to Matlab, then to C#, finally self-study Java. It seems that you have mastered many languages, but in fact, only you know how much weight and moisture there are. Now it's really time to rely on this technology to eat, many trivial technical problems have been exposed. Of course, those are afterwords.

&emsp;&emsp;I can't remember when I began to like programming. I vaguely remember when I graduated from high school and dreamed of owning a computer of my own. So I drew a keyboard key bitmap with my signature pen on my desk, familiar with the key position. What a funny memory!

&emsp;&emsp;<b>Code, computer hardware and software, this is my favorite.<font color=red>However, health is the most important thing.</font></b>

&emsp;&emsp;I remember when I was in college, a teacher said to us, "Your study is often not based on interest, but on motivation. In the future, many of you will not be able to take your interest as a work in your whole life." <b>So, I'm glad I'm doing a job I like.</b>
